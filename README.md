# Risks, Rates, and Rays: The Financial Realities of Brazil's Solar Revolution
This repository contains the datasets and code used in the study, 
*Risks, Rates, and Rays: The Financial Realities of Brazil's Solar Revolution*. 
The study explores how macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, 
influence the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) for solar photovoltaic (PV) projects in Brazil. 
The materials include calculations for Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), 
LCOE estimates for auction-awarded projects from 2014 to 2022, 
and scenario projections for financing conditions through 2029.

This repository contains the following files and directories:

### Jupyter Notebooks
1. `cost-of-capital.ipynb`: Calculates the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for solar PV projects using multiple datasets and produces the final WACC dataset for further analysis. Steps include:
   - Estimation of the BNDES rate.
   - Calculation of global risk-free rates, country default spreads, technology premiums, and cost of debt/equity.
   - Application of IRENA criteria to determine debt share and final WACC calculation.
   
2. `lcoe.ipynb`: Calculates the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) for solar PV projects using energy auction data and WACC estimates. Key steps include:
   - Cleaning and structuring energy auction data for analysis.
   - Estimation of OPEX and CAPEX baselines, adjusted for inflation.
   - Integration of WACC data from the first notebook to calculate LCOE with financing costs.
   - Analysis of changes in financing costs between 2014 and 2022.
   - Visualization of key metrics, including LCOE trends and auction dynamics.
   
3. `scenario-projection.ipynb`: Scenario projections 2024-2029, WACC calculations, LCOE projections, financing cost analysis. Steps include:
   - Generate Flat, Upward, and Downward scenarios for yields and inflation using regression results and historical trends.
   - Project monthly NTN-B bond yields and calculate corresponding BNDES rates.
   - Combine BNDES rate, technology premium, equity premium, and leverage to calculate WACC for each scenario.
   - Build CAPEX and OPEX baselines, incorporating learning curves (15% for CAPEX, 5% for OPEX).
   - Calculate LCOE for each scenario and assess financing costs.
   - Compare financing contributions across scenarios and calculate changes in financing costs from 2024 to 2029.
   - Plot LCOE trends, financing cost breakdowns, and percentage contributions (CAPEX, OPEX, and financing) under each scenario.
